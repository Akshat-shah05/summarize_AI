# summarize_AI

What is Does:
- Uses the RapidAPI AI article summarizer to summarize any article that can be found on the internet
- Incorporates a nice UI/UX experience

Things I learned:
- Setting up a react project using vite instead of create-react-app
- Used Tailwind as a postcss plugin (first time using something other than vanilla css)
- Learned Tailwind configuration
- Made advanced RTK query API requests --> Got the AI Model from RapidAPI
- Handling form events, form validation, form styling and error catching
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Further experience in responsive design while limiting media query usage

Goals:
- Create a project using redux and more complex state management
- Move on to learning backend --> node + express + mongo (full MERN stack)
- Learn Next.js
- Perfect either tailwind, or switch to sass
